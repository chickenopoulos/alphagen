# AlphaGen: Evolutionary Trading Strategy Generation

## Overview
AlphaGen is a framework that allows for optimal strategy search, using a custom genetic algorithm. The repo includes a Robustness Testing framework as well, which serves as a tool for testing the robustness of the evolved strategies, using a list of (statistical) tests. 

## How to use
Head over to the [Example.ipynb](notebooks/Example.ipynb) notebook for a step-by-step guide on how to use the framework.

## Next Steps / Work in Progress
- Add more robustness tests
- Incorporate robustness testing in the genetic algorithm (at least those that can be vectorized)
- Add more (non-parametric) indicators
